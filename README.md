# MedicaBase
A Angular based webapplication for alternative practitioners, in paticular for managing customer data, recipe data, drug data and also creating recipes for customers. *Note: All pictures and the entire seminar paper is available in German only!*


## Design
MedicaBase uses [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) for its graphical interface. The main idea was a easy to use and understandable graphical interface with a collapsible menu on the left side, as well as a permanent header on the top. This should allow all users to easily operate the program. The individual sub-items of the menu are additionally highlighted in color, which should benifit the user in their workflow.

## Layout and Workflow
The image shows everything, the user can do. Every step shows the relations to other steps and its own functions. The menu and header are linked to every single function its linked with. For example you always have to login at the beginning or you can create a new recipe template while creating a new recipe for a customer.
